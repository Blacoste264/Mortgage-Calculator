Built a mortgage calculator using Javascript & Angular.
Calculate monthly payment on a home mortgage. Built form that accepts the loan balance, interest rate, loan term in years and period (either monthly or bi-monthly) and a calculate button. My mother needed a mortgage calculator, so I made one! ;)
